# Proverb Orbits ðŸŒŒ

An interactive p5.js web application for **Connections Lab â€” Project 1**.

## Concept
Proverb Orbits visualizes African proverbs as orbiting nodes in a star map.  
Each proverb is stored in a JSON dataset and represented as a moving body with interactive behaviors.  

- **Filter** by theme (Wisdom, Community, Resilience, Destiny).  
- **Search** by keyword (e.g. "river", "courage").  
- **Adjust energy** to speed up or slow down orbits.  
- **Hover** to reveal proverb text, language, and origin.  

## Files
- `index.html` â†’ site structure + loads p5.js and scripts  
- `style.css` â†’ design, layout, and theming  
- `script.js` â†’ interactive logic and visualization  
- `data.json` â†’ dataset of proverbs  

## Tech
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
